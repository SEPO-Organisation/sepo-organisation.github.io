<font style="font-size:24px"><b>Introduction</b></font><br><br>
What is SEPO? We are a student organisation fighting against climate change and the destruction of our planet by advocating not only changes in our energy sources, but wider systemic changes to completely alter the way our society manages production, resources and the economy. With these changes, which will be outlined in detail in the rest of the manifesto, we hope to create a society that does not partake in overproduction and is actually willing to reform itself around new environmentally friendly measures instead of focusing on profit above all else. When the entire existence of the world is at stake, changes must be huge and sweeping, and this crisis cannot be solved by merely building a few solar panels and wind farms. There must be change in the very core of our system. However, before all that, we must first introduce what the climate crisis even is, and the main factors within it. 
</p><hr>
<p><font style="font-size:24px"><b>Issues in the Environment</b></font><br><br>
Of course, there is the crisis of global warming. It is getting more and more obvious with each passing year and frankly needs no introduction. Our summers are getting hotter, winters are shorter, and the weather is getting more extreme. The ice-caps are melting and millions are being displaced as the waters swallow their homes while in other regions, raging fires destroy our forests and burn the locals who live around them. The fires in California, Turkey, the hurricanes in Florida, the increasingly unbearable summers, it is all becoming more and more obvious every day that something is terribly wrong with our climate.
</p>
<p>
Then, there is the issue of pollution. Our rivers keep getting dirtier as more rubbish and industrial waste is dumped into them, and the landfills consistently keep getting larger and larger. Meanwhile, pollution from fossil fuels is also the primary driver of the climate crisis. In fact, all of these crises are very deeply interconnected, and they all come together. The deforestation and excess production and burning of fossil fuels when we have many good alternatives and the refusal to develop them. All those issues and more can all be traced back to the very system that our societies are built around.</p>
<hr>
<p><font style="font-size:24px"><b>Root Cause of the Issues</b></font><br><br>
Ultimately, all of these issues have their roots in our system, which prioritises profits above all else. A society dominated by monopolies and oligarchs who seek to expand their own pockets regardless of the cost their actions have in terms of human lives and environmental disaster is what causes us to be in the position we are in today. No matter how many times you may donate to a charity, or recycle your trash, it won’t change anything. Because the ultimate cause of the issue is not you as an individual, it is the entire wider system that drives the crisis. </p>

<p>Big oil corporations constantly push against green policies while being the biggest polluters. Then there are companies which produce consumer goods by exploiting the developing nations of the world, they pollute those countries with their large factories, exploit their population, and then blame them for the pollution that they’re inflicting upon them. That is why SEPO argues for change to start not from individuals or developing nations, but for us to start by identifying and targeting the true leaders of these disastrous policies. It must be noted that the people behind these companies are also the most powerful people in the entire world, and they hoard vast amounts of wealth and status. If we, as a society, want to survive the oncoming catastrophe or avoid it altogether, it is imperative that we stick together and recognise that the problems are from the top.</p>

<p>
But what is the solution to a problem as deeply entrenched in our society as this one, and with stakes as high as the survival of the planet?
</p>

<p><font style="font-size:24px"><b>The Proposed Solution</b></font><br><br>
We propose wide systemic change which will give the reigns of production to a truly representative state that is controlled by the population. This is because, based on our analysis before, corporations and the drive for profit are the root cause of the climate crisis, and a system such as this therefore cannot be trusted to keep the environment clean. In contrast, a system where production is made for the sake of social improvement and not profit, and where it is controlled democratically, will have much less excesses and will not fight against solutions in the way a corporation would. For example, a profit-seeking corporation would never accept the shift away from fossil fuels to renewable solely because renewable energy is not profitable, and oil is very profitable. However, in a system where profit is not exemplified as the end-all goal of a democratic corporation, it will be much more keen on accepting new ideas and changing, even if that has no immediate economic benefits, because economic benefits are not the purpose.  </p>
<p>We seek to take away power from the corporations through government programmes and reforms, while many European democracies have made good progress on this, we believe it is not enough but we still have faith that the world’s nations and people can band together and go in that direction for the good of all of humanity. This is something that can be solved only with the collective action of all people, not just one nation, not just one small group, and especially not just a single person. That is why our organisation triumphs recruitment of more members and cooperation with others who have similar goals and principles to us. </p>
<p>In essence, we advocate the end of a profit system and its replacement by a system that optimises society for the best. This will lead to significantly decreased pollution output, a much smoother transition away from fossil fuels since there is no one to oppose it, and more consolidated efforts to find alternatives such as fusion energy and non-polluting batteries.  </p>
<p>On the topic of energy and outside the systemic solutions, we plan on implementing nuclear energy first and foremost, and also driving research into more renewable batteries due to the inherent unsustainability of current lithium batteries. Our organisation largely rejects solar power in its current state due to its also pollutive nature, as it covers vast amounts of land and reflects a lot of heat into our atmosphere, all to power a miniscule fraction of what a single nuclear power plant can. For those reasons, we believe solar is merely a diversion from the only truly sustainable solution: nuclear. While wind can be good for smaller-scale operations, it is still no match for nuclear power overall. We also advocate for a lot more funding into the development and construction of fusion energy.  One might of course argue the perceived “dangers” of nuclear energy, but to that we present the fact that out of thousands of nuclear plants, only two have caused disasters, and one was as a result of a huge earthquake and tsunami in Fukushima, and the other, in Chernobyl, was in a state 5 years away from total collapse and was an old reactor in disrepair. Modern reactors are constantly maintained and have many many safety nets to prevent any errors from causing such a catastrophe. On the other hand, fossil fuels cause immeasurable suffering upon all populations and polluted air is one of the leading causes of respiratory illnesses among most people in the world. </p>

<p>
In conclusion, all these changes will also come with huge benefits, such as the end of neo-colonial practices and a fairer society where the average person does not work at the edge of poverty.  But what does our organisation have to do with any of this?
