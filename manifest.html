<font style="font-size:24px"><b>Introduction</b></font><br><br>
What is SEPO? We are a student organisation fighting against climate change and the destruction of our planet by advocating not only changes in our energy sources, but wider systemic changes to completely alter the way our society manages production, resources and the economy. With these changes, which will be outlined in detail in the rest of the manifesto, we hope to create a society that does not partake in overproduction and is actually willing to reform itself around new environmentally friendly measures instead of focusing on profit above all else. When the entire existence of the world is at stake, changes must be huge and sweeping, and this crisis cannot be solved by merely building a few solar panels and wind farms. There must be change in the very core of our system. However, before all that, we must first introduce what the climate crisis even is, and the main factors within it. 
</p><hr>
<p><font style="font-size:24px"><b>Issues in the Environment</b></font><br><br>
Of course, there is the crisis of global warming. It is getting more and more obvious with each passing year and frankly needs no introduction. Our summers are getting hotter, winters are shorter, and the weather is getting more extreme. The ice-caps are melting and millions are being displaced as the waters swallow their homes while in other regions, raging fires destroy our forests and burn the locals who live around them. The fires in California, Turkey, the hurricanes in Florida, the increasingly unbearable summers, it is all becoming more and more obvious every day that something is terribly wrong with our climate.
</p>
<p>
Then, there is the issue of pollution. Our rivers keep getting dirtier as more rubbish and industrial waste is dumped into them, and the landfills consistently keep getting larger and larger. Meanwhile, pollution from fossil fuels is also the primary driver of the climate crisis. In fact, all of these crises are very deeply interconnected, and they all come together. The deforestation and excess production and burning of fossil fuels when we have many good alternatives and the refusal to develop them. All those issues and more can all be traced back to the very system that our societies are built around.</p>
<hr>
<p><font style="font-size:24px"><b>Root Cause of the Issues</b></font><br><br>
Ultimately, all of these issues have their roots in our system, which prioritises profits above all else. A society dominated by monopolies and oligarchs who seek to expand their own pockets regardless of the cost their actions have in terms of human lives and environmental disaster is what causes us to be in the position we are in today. No matter how many times you may donate to a charity, or recycle your trash, it won’t change anything. Because the ultimate cause of the issue is not you as an individual, it is the entire wider system that drives the crisis. </p>

<p>Big oil corporations constantly push against green policies while being the biggest polluters. Then there are companies which produce consumer goods by exploiting the developing nations of the world, they pollute those countries with their large factories, exploit their population, and then blame them for the pollution that they’re inflicting upon them. That is why SEPO argues for change to start not from individuals or developing nations, but for us to start by identifying and targeting the true leaders of these disastrous policies. It must be noted that the people behind these companies are also the most powerful people in the entire world, and they hoard vast amounts of wealth and status. If we, as a society, want to survive the oncoming catastrophe or avoid it altogether, it is imperative that we stick together and recognise that the problems are from the top.</p>

<p>
But what is the solution to a problem as deeply entrenched in our society as this one, and with stakes as high as the survival of the planet?
</p>
<hr>

<p><font style="font-size:24px"><b>The Proposed Solution</b></font><br><br>
We propose wide systemic change which will give the reigns of production to a truly representative state that is controlled by the population. This is because, based on our analysis before, corporations and the drive for profit are the root cause of the climate crisis, and a system such as this therefore cannot be trusted to keep the environment clean. In contrast, a system where production is made for the sake of social improvement and not profit, and where it is controlled democratically, will have much less excesses and will not fight against solutions in the way a corporation would. For example, a profit-seeking corporation would never accept the shift away from fossil fuels to renewable solely because renewable energy is not profitable, and oil is very profitable. However, in a system where profit is not exemplified as the end-all goal of a democratic corporation, it will be much more keen on accepting new ideas and changing, even if that has no immediate economic benefits, because economic benefits are not the purpose.  </p>
<p>We seek to take away power from the corporations through government programmes and reforms, while many European democracies have made good progress on this, we believe it is not enough but we still have faith that the world’s nations and people can band together and go in that direction for the good of all of humanity. This is something that can be solved only with the collective action of all people, not just one nation, not just one small group, and especially not just a single person. That is why our organisation triumphs recruitment of more members and cooperation with others who have similar goals and principles to us. </p>
<p>In essence, we advocate the end of a profit system and its replacement by a system that optimises society for the best. This will lead to significantly decreased pollution output, a much smoother transition away from fossil fuels since there is no one to oppose it, and more consolidated efforts to find alternatives such as fusion energy and non-polluting batteries.  </p>
<p>On the topic of energy and outside the systemic solutions, we plan on implementing nuclear energy first and foremost, and also driving research into more renewable batteries due to the inherent unsustainability of current lithium batteries. Our organisation largely rejects solar power in its current state due to its also pollutive nature, as it covers vast amounts of land and reflects a lot of heat into our atmosphere, all to power a miniscule fraction of what a single nuclear power plant can. For those reasons, we believe solar is merely a diversion from the only truly sustainable solution: nuclear. While wind can be good for smaller-scale operations, it is still no match for nuclear power overall. We also advocate for a lot more funding into the development and construction of fusion energy.  One might of course argue the perceived “dangers” of nuclear energy, but to that we present the fact that out of thousands of nuclear plants, only two have caused disasters, and one was as a result of a huge earthquake and tsunami in Fukushima, and the other, in Chernobyl, was in a state 5 years away from total collapse and was an old reactor in disrepair. Modern reactors are constantly maintained and have many many safety nets to prevent any errors from causing such a catastrophe. On the other hand, fossil fuels cause immeasurable suffering upon all populations and polluted air is one of the leading causes of respiratory illnesses among most people in the world. </p>

<p>
In conclusion, all these changes will also come with huge benefits, such as the end of neo-colonial practices and a fairer society where the average person does not work at the edge of poverty.  But what does our organisation have to do with any of this?

</p>

<hr>
<p><font style="font-size:24px"><b>The Purpose of SEPO</b></font><br><br>
We aim to be the proponents of these ideas within not only our school, but maybe the rest of the city and maybe even the country or the world itself. We aim to unite the international people behind the noble goal of saving our planet instead of fighting wars with each other and being continually exploited by those who cause all our problems to begin with. When we speak of uniting the world, we do not just mean western countries like many similar organisations have meant in practice. We aim to unite the developing world in our struggle too, as we believe that similarly to how change comes from pressure from below within a state, the same applies to international politics. The exploited nations of the developing world must stand up to the corporations and empires which pollute their waters and extract their resources in order to free themselves and save the planet in the process.
</p>
<p>To summarise our purpose, we are here to spread the message, and maybe even be one of the participants or even leaders of the global movement to end the destruction of the climate.
 </p><hr>
 <p><font style="font-size:24px"><b>How we Plan to Implement the Solution</b></font><br><br>
 As stated previously, due to the nature of our proposed changes and the system’s domination from above, we will be focusing on pushing up from below. This involves spreading the message through social media, making contact with other like-minded organisations, perhaps holding speeches and conferences with other organisations. Within the school we will also hold after-school club meetings where we will discuss the issues of the modern day and decide the organisation’s opinions on them. We believe that together, through peaceful means, we can push for real change within the system and hopefully contribute to saving the climate. This process also of course involves protesting, maybe going on strike, and other such actions in order to make change.

 </p><hr>
 <p><font style="font-size:24px"><b>The Internal Structure of SEPO</b></font><br><br>
 SEPO will have a semi-democratic structure, where decisions will be made by popular consensus among all members. There will be a Consul and Chairperson at the top. While the Chairperson will be a more permanent role, unless they resign or are specifically voted out by popular opinion, the Consul will be subject to change in periodical elections. The Consul will carry a lot of the important decisions while the Chairperson’s job will be to moderate and ensure that the Consul does not drastically deviate from the organisation’s line and overall, will be a stabilising figure to keep consistency within SEPO. <br>
 The Senate is the body below the Consul and Chairperson, they will act as advisors to the Consul and Chairperson, they shall be decided by elections from the rest of the party, and the candidates will be confirmed by the Chair. The Senators are to be the best performing and most educated among the organisation’s members. As a result, the ability to call for votes and the resignation of the current Chairperson rests in their hands. Essentially, they are like an upper parliament. They are the voice of the rest of the organisation and a stabilising force within it. This way, we can ensure democracy while maintaining stability and seeing to it that there will be no bad actors.
<br>
During times when a decision must be made quickly however, power is entrusted to the Consul and Chairperson to be able to swiftly make a correct decision, with the ultimate final say in the situation resting in the Chairperson, as they should ideally be the best-suited and wisest of the organisation.

 </p><hr>
 <p><font style="font-size:24px"><b>Our Guiding Principles & Conclusion</b></font><br><br>
 We believe in these fundamental principles:
 </p>
 <p><b> Materialism:</b><br>
We believe in the importance of looking for the real material causes of each issue by looking at where it originated and who it benefits the most. By searching for this, we can easily assess the root cause and therefore the solution to each problem. One of the exemplary instances of this is our opinion on the climate crisis. We analysed it, looked for who is behind it, looked for who benefits from it, and who controls the tools which cause the issues, and we came to the conclusion that it is the system of corporate elites which are responsible. Using similar methods, we may determine our opinions and solutions on other issues globally. </p>
<p> <b>Democracy:</b><br>
We believe in the voice of all of our members. Anyone will be able to make a proposal and it will be heard and discussed freely within the organisation, and the operational rules and constitution will too be subject to change as the people see fit. Democracy and rule of the majority are one of our primary beliefs and one of the vital factors in ending the destruction of our environment.</p>
<p> <b>Equity:</b><br>
To avoid confusion, the definition of equity we are using is “the quality of being fair and impartial” and not the economic term. We value equity and the rights of all, no matter their age, gender, race, nation, social status, or any other identifying quality to a voice and a right to live without fear of eviction. Of course this means we are also against all those who do discriminate on those lines, and we will not tolerate any such behaviour within our organisation.</p>
<p> In conclusion, we believe in a systemic cause for the climate crisis, one that is deeply ingrained into our society and way of life. As a result, we believe that our priorities should lie beyond simple volunteer work and instead we should primarily focus on activism and organisation of the population in order so that we may convince those above to cease their destructive behaviour and hopefully implement as many of our proposals as possible. We also will promote study and research on these topics within our organisation which will benefit our members greatly. The crisis has never been worse as this is written, but during these pivotal times, we at SEPO hope to participate in pushing for the change people want to see in the world, and fight for a greener, and brighter future.
