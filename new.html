<p style="font-size: 28px"><b> SEPO Founded Today!</b></p>
<p style="font-size: 18px">The Student's Environmental Preservation Organisation has officially opened on this day! A meeting will be arranged soon, but SEPO now officially has 17 members on it's first day. There has been a lot of time spent on organising this body, but SEPO's story has only just begun. We hope that this organisation truly reaches it's potential and of course, that our goals to stop the climate crisis are achieved. While there is still much work to be done, the foundation of a proper organisation like SEPO in this school and in the city is a huge first step in the right direction. Thank you for reading the first post on this newsletter!</p>
